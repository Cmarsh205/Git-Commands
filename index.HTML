        <div class="container">
          <h2>Git Add</h2>
          <p>
            Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. This
            gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it
            to the official history.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <h2>Git Branch</h2>
          <p>
            This command is your general-purpose branch administration tool. It
            lets you create isolated development environments within a single
            repository.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <h2>Git Clone</h2>
          <p>
            Creates a copy of an existing Git repository. Cloning is the most
            common way for developers to obtain a working copy of a central
            repository.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <h2>Git Commit</h2>
          <p>
            Takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history.
            Combined with git add, this defines the basic workflow for all Git
            users.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <h2>Git Init</h2>
          <p>
            Initializes a new Git repository. If you want to place a project
            under revision control, this is the first command you need to learn.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <h2>Git Log</h2>
          <p>
            Lets you explore the previous revisions of a project. It provides
            several formatting options for displaying committed snapshots.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <h2>Git Merge</h2>
          <p>
            A powerful way to integrate changes from divergent branches. After
            forking the project history with git branch, git merge lets you put
            it back together again.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <h2>Git Pull</h2>
          <p>
            Pulling is the automated version of git fetch. It downloads a branch
            from a remote repository, then immediately merges it into the
            current branch. This is the Git equivalent of svn update.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <h2>Git Push</h2>
          <p>
            Pushing is the opposite of fetching (with a few caveats). It lets
            you move a local branch to another repository, which serves as a
            convenient way to publish contributions. This is like svn commit,
            but it sends a series of commits instead of a single changeset.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <h2>Git Fetch</h2>
          <p>
            Fetching downloads a branch from another repository, along with all
            of its associated commits and files. But, it doesn't try to
            integrate anything into your local repository. This gives you a
            chance to inspect changes before merging them with your project.
